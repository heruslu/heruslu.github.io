<span class="news">Internship at Theiss Research/NIST, 2018 Summer</span><br /> 
<p>I was a research assistant at Theiss Research under the supervision of Dr. Gunay Dogan at NIST for the summer. We developed a user friendly Python library for image segmentation problem. Our goal was resolving the surface of unknown objects in given 3D images.</p><br /> 

<p>The tools we have implemented can be used in material science and medical imaging to obtain the numerical approximation of the surfaces and to help conducting numerical experiments. These experiments can then be run numerous times with no cost in order to simulate any desired effect in the material or the internal organ.</p><br /> 

<p>Our work is still continuing and we will make the entire library available on GitHub.</p><br />

<span class="news">Excellence in Graduate Teaching Award, 2018 May</span><br />
<p>I was humbled by 2017 Excellence in Graduate Teaching Award. It is a university-wide award which is given up to 2 graduate students each year. It also includes a financial gift of $1,500. I received my award at the University Faculty Senate Meeting on May 7, 2018. Below is a picture taken by Dean of College of Arts George Watson (Thank you Dean Watson! He was kind enough to<a href="https://twitter.com/ghw55/status/993588823513862144"> tweet</a> this great news as well). My award was also recognized at our Departmental Colloquium and Annual College of Arts and Science Celebrating Achievement and Success event. You can read more about this award, and check out UDaily and our department‘s kind comments about it.</p><br /> 

<p>Acknowledgement: I want to thank everyone who nominated me for this award. I am grateful for all my teachers, mentors and advisors who helped me to build my current teaching philosophy. Special thanks for my first grade teacher Mrs. Tunc and my high school teachers from Manisa, Turkey for their extraordinary dedication!</p><br />

<p>I was at Nonlocal School of Fractional Equations. It was great to learn a little bit about the regularity and numerical methods for some fractional equations from Dr. Luis Caffarelli and Dr.Ricardo Nochetto. I was lucky enough to take a picture with Dr. Nochetto � </p><br />
